          <p>
            I am currently a senior (12th-grade) student at the No. 2 High
            School of East China Normal University in Shanghai, China.
            <br /><br />As a USACO Platinum Division achiever, I have a strong
            foundation in programming across multiple languages, including C++,
            Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, as well as interpretive languages
            such as Markdown and LaTeX. I participated in FRC robotics training
            and led the mechanical design of five robots. <br /><br />Aficionado
            of linguistics, politics, and history, I have conducted research
            projects on extinct East Asian languages, performed public policy
            analyses on East Asian geopolitics, and developed a history-oriented
            oral interview series. One research paper focusing on nationalism
            was published. <br /><br />On a pre-professional track, I have
            secured internships in high school admissions, outreach, and
            interviewing. I also conducted data research focused on predicting
            stock movements and gained insights in real-world stock trading.
            <br /><br />As an avid athlete, I am a professional golf player who
            competes in state-level competitions. Additionally, I have extensive
            experience in badminton, table tennis, squash, and soccer.
